            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>The internet plays a big part in most American lives. With an estimated of 3.5 billion internet users worldwide in 2016 approximating to about 45 percent of the global population. With all these people reliant on a single medium, it is expected that such a resource should be free and available to everyone. However, in December of 2017 the FCC moved to repeal net neutrality allowing internet service providers (ISPs) to regulate traffic dependent on the website or data being transferred. This means what you can see, along with the speed of your connection, are at risk of falling victim to the profit-seeking control of powerful ISPs. Now, access to websites can be throttled, charged, or even blocked. Internet providers like Verizon can create paid fast lanes, meaning you have to pay not just for the basic access to internet, but for specific websites you want to access. This could be buying a media package with Youtube and Netflix, or buying an online shopping package with Amazon and Zappos. Then, ISPs can unequivocally block or slow competitors websites, which may not be a problem for bigger companies, but can destroy startups that are unable to pay ISPs for access to their websites.</p>
              
            <p>The termination of Net Neutrality regulations will start to take place next month, meaning Internet Providers will be able to experiment with some of the services described above; however, this does not mean the end of the internet. Internet Policing will now be up to the Federal Trade Commission. This is less than ideal because the FTC oversees consumer protection in the whole economy, and will not be able to crack down with the same scrutiny as the FCC did. Also, the FTC lacks the power to make rules so FTC enforcement only extends to voluntary public commitments or violations of antitrust law. The other deterrent people say will stop ISPs abusing their power is good old capitalism. Creating fast lanes and slow lanes will push consumers away, and ISPs will not want to take that risk. Others say, however, that in rural settings there may be no other competition, and that internet access will become unbearable for people who have to stick with an overpriced or unmanageable internet provider. As it looks now, the chances that a neutral internet will help consumers seems slim, and the outcome that Internet Service Providers will exercise strategies like paid packages and fast lanes seems all to probable.</p>
              
            <h3>Influence</h3>
            <p>One movement thatâ€™s closely related to net neutrality is the consumer movement of the early 1900s. During this time industrialism in America was at its height and cities were becoming overcrowded. Injurious and substandard products such as unsafe food and medicines routinely victimized consumers. That is when journalists called muckrakers started writing about companies, scrutinizing their unsafe practices and methods of manufacture to better the costumer. This idea of consumers and the media banding together to protect themselves has greatly impacted how we address net neutrality today.</p>
              
            <p>In the 1920s and 1930s AT&#38;T had a near monopoly on telephone service. At the same time phones had become essential to business, so they set their prices accordingly. Banks, Steel companies, and other large areas of business lobbied for equal pricing and treatment. They argued that telephone companies supply a similar service that bridges do, and favoring certain traffic over others can destroy business. In response to this the Communications Act of 1934 was passed classifying phone service as common carrier. Companies like AT&#38;T could no longer discriminate against a company that does not want to pay extra for service. This directly applies net neutrality because the internet used to fall under the same classifications. Back in 2015 the internet was labeled by the FCC under the same Title II regulations as phones services. Meaning no discrimination for speed of connection or payment between content suppliers or websites --the heart of net neutrality.</p>
